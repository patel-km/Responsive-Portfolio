            Hi there! 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            My name is Karishma Patel.
            </p>

            I'm a UI/UX designer with interests in projects aimed at innovation and social good. I value human-centered design, because it focuses on iterating products and services based on real people's needs and desires, as opposed to innovating for the sake of creating something new. In the past 30 years, the world has seen wildly transformative, rapid change thanks to technology and I aim to join the industry and apply these new technologies to local and global issues. 
            </p>

            <p>
            While my career lies in technologies and innovation, I am a big advocate for unplugging and spending time outdoors. I was fortunate enough to live off-the-grid for 10 weeks in 2017, and I can't recommend that sort of experience enough. Nature offers endless inspiration, and I hope to apply biomimicry to more of my designs.
            </p>

            <p>
            I received my BA in Media & Journalism from the University of North Carolina at Chapel HIll in May 2017. I hope to continue my education in media or relevant design fields in the future.
